# City Data Analyzer Frontend

This directory hosts the Next.js UI for the monorepo. It currently contains a minimal placeholder page so you can wire up the Python API backend located in `apps/python-backend`.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies from the repository root:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run --workspace frontend dev
   ```

Update the placeholder content in `app/page.tsx` as you build out the frontend experience.
